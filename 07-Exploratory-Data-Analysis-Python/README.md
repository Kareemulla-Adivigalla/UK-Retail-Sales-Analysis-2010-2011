# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Sales Trends Analysis Project

## Overview

This document outlines the complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process conducted on the Sales Trends Analysis Project. EDA was performed to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset, enabling more informed decision-making during the modeling phase.

## Objectives of EDA

- **Understand the Data Structure**: Gain familiarity with the data by examining the distribution, summary statistics, and relationships between variables.
- **Identify Key Trends**: Explore seasonal patterns, peak sales periods, and overall sales trends.
- **Detect Anomalies**: Identify and handle any anomalies, such as outliers or missing data, that could impact the analysis.
- **Prepare Data for Modeling**: Ensure that the dataset is in the best possible state for subsequent modeling and forecasting.

## EDA Process

### 1. Initial Data Exploration

- **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded and inspected to understand its structure and contents.
- **Summary Statistics**: Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were calculated for key variables such as `Total_Sales`, `Quantity`, and `Price`.
- **Missing Values**: A thorough check for missing values was conducted, and missing data was handled based on the importance of the variable (e.g., dropping rows, imputing values).

### 2. Data Visualization

#### a. **Sales Trends Over Time**

- **Monthly Sales Analysis**: 
  - A line chart was created to visualize the total sales by month, revealing trends and seasonal patterns over time.
  - Key findings: Sales demonstrated a noticeable seasonal trend, with peaks during specific months that could be linked to holidays or promotions.

- **Quarterly Sales Analysis**: 
  - Total sales were aggregated by quarter and visualized to understand broader trends.
  - Key findings: A consistent upward trend was observed on a quarterly basis, with notable increases in Q4, likely driven by holiday shopping.

#### b. **Sales by Day of the Week**

- **Weekday Sales Analysis**:
  - Sales were grouped by day of the week to identify which days contributed most to total sales.
  - Key findings: Sales were highest on weekends, with a noticeable dip during mid-week days.

#### c. **Sales by Season**

- **Seasonal Sales Analysis**:
  - A bar chart was created to visualize total sales by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).
  - Key findings: Sales were highest during the Winter season, likely due to holiday shopping, followed by steady sales in other seasons.

### 3. Correlation Analysis

- **Correlation Heatmap**:
  - A heatmap was generated to explore the relationships between `Total_Sales`, `Quantity`, `Price`, and time-based features such as `Month`, `Quarter`, and `DayOfWeek`.
  - Key findings: 
    - Strong correlations were observed between `Total_Sales` and `Quantity`, indicating that higher quantities sold directly contributed to higher sales.
    - No significant correlations were found between `Total_Sales` and specific days of the week, suggesting that sales were not strongly dependent on the day itself.

### 4. Anomaly Detection

- **Outlier Analysis**:
  - Boxplots and scatter plots were used to detect outliers in key variables such as `Quantity` and `Price`.
  - Actions Taken: 
    - Outliers that represented genuine data points (e.g., large bulk orders) were retained.
    - Anomalies likely due to data entry errors (e.g., negative quantities or zero prices) were corrected or removed.

### 5. Feature Engineering for EDA

- **Time-Based Features**:
  - Features such as `Month`, `Quarter`, `Season`, and `Weekday` were engineered to enhance the EDA process and provide more granular insights.
  - **Lag Features**: 
    - Created lag features to capture the effect of previous sales on future sales. This was especially useful for understanding the temporal dynamics of sales trends.
  
- **Rolling Statistics**:
  - Calculated rolling mean and sum for `Total_Sales` to smooth out fluctuations and better capture underlying trends.

### 6. Key Findings

- **Seasonality**: A strong seasonal trend was observed, particularly during the holiday season, which drives significant spikes in sales.
- **Day-of-Week Patterns**: Weekends showed higher sales, indicating consumer shopping behavior is influenced by the day of the week.
- **Correlation Insights**: Strong positive correlation between `Quantity` and `Total_Sales`, highlighting that increasing product quantities sold leads to higher sales revenue.

### 7. Conclusions and Next Steps

The EDA process provided valuable insights into the sales trends, helping to identify key drivers of sales and potential areas for further analysis. The data is now well-prepared for the next steps, which include:

- **Modeling**: Implementing predictive models (e.g., ARIMA, XGBoost) to forecast future sales based on the trends identified during EDA.
- **Visualization**: Creating dashboards and visual reports to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.
