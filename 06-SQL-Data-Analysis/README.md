# Sales Forecasting SQL Analysis Process

This file provides an overview of the SQL analysis process used to prepare, analyze, and forecast sales data for the Sales Forecasting Project. This document outlines the steps taken to clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate sales forecasts based on the processed data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to forecast future sales using historical data stored in a SQL Server database. The analysis involves a series of SQL queries to clean the data, perform exploratory analysis, and prepare the dataset for forecasting models. The final objective is to provide accurate and actionable sales forecasts that can be used for business decision-making.

## SQL Analysis Process

### 1. Database Setup
- Imported the sales data into SQL Server, creating a table named `updated_sales_dataset_with_features`.
- Established the database connection using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or another SQL client.

### 2. Data Preparation
- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - Imputed missing values in key columns using the mean values to ensure the dataset was complete for analysis.
- **Renaming Columns for Clarity:**
  - Renamed columns to follow a consistent naming convention with underscores, improving readability and making the dataset easier to work with.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sales Overview:**
  - Analyzed total sales by month, quarter, and year to understand overall sales trends.
- **Peak Sales Periods:**
  - Identified periods with exceptionally high sales by comparing sales data against average sales, focusing on months and quarters where sales exceeded typical levels.
- **Seasonal Variations:**
  - Compared sales across different seasons to identify any consistent seasonal patterns, such as increased sales during certain months or quarters.

### 4. Sales Forecasting
- **Preparing Data for Forecasting:**
  - Aggregated the sales data by week, month, and quarter to create time series datasets suitable for forecasting.
- **Exporting Data for Modeling:**
  - Exported the processed data to a CSV file, which was then used for time series forecasting models outside of SQL Server.


## Conclusion

The SQL analysis process was essential in preparing the sales data for accurate forecasting. By cleaning the data, performing EDA, and creating necessary features, a strong foundation was established for building effective forecasting models. The resulting forecasts provide valuable insights into future sales trends, enabling better planning and decision-making.
