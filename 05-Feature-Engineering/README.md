# Feature Engineering for Sales Trends Analysis Project

## Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of the feature engineering process undertaken in the Sales Trends Analysis Project. Feature engineering was critical in enhancing the dataset, enabling more accurate analysis and modeling by creating additional relevant features that captured key aspects of the data.

## Objectives of Feature Engineering

- **Enhance Predictive Power**: Create new features that capture important patterns and relationships in the data to improve the performance of predictive models.
- **Capture Temporal Dynamics**: Engineer time-based features to better understand and model seasonal trends, periodic patterns, and sales cycles.
- **Improve Data Representation**: Refine existing features and create new ones to provide a more comprehensive view of the data, enabling deeper analysis and insights.

## Feature Engineering Process

### 1. Time-Based Features

Time-based features were engineered to capture the temporal aspects of the sales data, which are crucial for understanding trends and seasonality.

#### a. **Year, Month, and Day Features**
- **Year**: Extracted from the `Invoice_date` to capture yearly trends.
- **Month**: Extracted from the `Invoice_date` to analyze monthly sales patterns and seasonality.
- **Day**: Extracted from the `Invoice_date` to investigate daily sales patterns and their fluctuations.

#### b. **Weekday Feature**
- **Weekday**: Extracted the day of the week (e.g., Monday, Tuesday) from the `Invoice_date` to explore how sales vary by day. This helped identify patterns like higher sales on weekends.

#### c. **Quarter Feature**
- **Quarter**: Derived from the `Invoice_date` to understand quarterly trends. This was particularly useful in identifying spikes in sales during specific quarters, such as Q4 for holiday shopping.

#### d. **Season Feature**
- **Season**: Created a seasonal feature by mapping months to seasons (e.g., Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall). This feature was instrumental in analyzing sales patterns across different times of the year.

### 2. Lag Features

Lag features were created to capture the effect of past sales on future sales, which is essential for time series modeling.

- **Lag_1, Lag_7, Lag_30**:
  - **Lag_1**: Captured the sales value from the previous period (e.g., previous day or month).
  - **Lag_7**: Captured the sales from one week prior, helping to understand weekly recurring patterns.
  - **Lag_30**: Captured the sales from one month prior, providing insights into monthly cyclic patterns.

These lag features were critical for models like ARIMA and XGBoost, which rely on past values to predict future sales.

### 3. Rolling Statistics

Rolling statistics were computed to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends and patterns.

- **Rolling Mean**:
  - **Rolling_Mean_7**: Calculated the 7-day rolling average of `Total_Sales` to smooth out daily volatility and highlight weekly trends.
  - **Rolling_Mean_30**: Calculated the 30-day rolling average of `Total_Sales` to smooth out monthly fluctuations and reveal longer-term trends.

- **Rolling Sum**:
  - **Rolling_Sum_7**: Summed `Total_Sales` over the past 7 days to capture the cumulative sales in a week.
  - **Rolling_Sum_30**: Summed `Total_Sales` over the past 30 days to capture the cumulative sales over a month.

These rolling statistics provided a clearer view of sales trends and were particularly useful for identifying underlying patterns that could be used in forecasting.

### 4. Special Events Feature

#### **Is_Christmas_Season**
- **Is_Christmas_Season**: A binary feature indicating whether the date fell within the Christmas season (typically defined as November and December). This feature was used to capture the significant spike in sales during the holiday season, which is a crucial period for retail.

### 5. Data Integrity and Consistency Checks

- **Consistency Checks**: Ensured that the newly created features were consistent with the original data. For instance, verified that the `Quarter` and `Month` features aligned correctly with the `Invoice_date`.
- **Range Validation**: Checked that the numerical values in the new features were within expected ranges (e.g., `Lag_1` values logically followed the `Total_Sales` of the previous period).

## Key Findings

- **Seasonality**: The seasonal feature clearly showed that the highest sales occurred during the Winter season, particularly around the Christmas period.
- **Lagged Effects**: The lag features revealed strong autocorrelation in the sales data, indicating that past sales are a good predictor of future sales.
- **Rolling Trends**: Rolling means and sums helped to smooth out volatility, providing a more stable trend that was easier to model and forecast.
- **Day-of-Week Patterns**: The weekday feature showed that sales tended to be higher on weekends, which is valuable for planning marketing campaigns and inventory.

## Conclusions and Next Steps

The feature engineering process significantly enhanced the dataset, making it more suitable for accurate modeling and analysis. The new features captured critical patterns in the sales data, enabling more effective forecasting and deeper insights.

### Next Steps:
- **Modeling**: Use the engineered features to train and evaluate predictive models (e.g., ARIMA, XGBoost).
- **Further Analysis**: Explore additional interactions between features (e.g., combining `Month` and `Is_Christmas_Season`) to uncover more complex relationships.
- **Optimization**: Fine-tune the models using grid search or other optimization techniques to improve forecasting accuracy.
